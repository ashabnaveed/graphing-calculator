# graphing-calculator
Python code of a graphing calculator using numpy and matplotlib for visualization of the functions. Can be used to make basic calculations, and plot linear and non-linear functions.

In order to use the calculator, you must press run and input either c, g, or q, which will lead to a calculation. graphing, and quit respectively.

The calculator can be used by inputting values in the terminal. The following operations are binded to the keyboard functions:
Multiplication  *
Addition  +
Subtraction  -
Division /
Squaring ^

You can also use more advanced operations such as sin. cos, tan, and log by inputting a value in brackets:
Example sin(30)

Aditionally, brackets may be used to evaluate expressions. Note the brackets that must be used are ().

As for graphing, the input is the equation that is plotting y. so, an input of x+1 will show a linear line.
At the moment, it is advised you only input linear equations as those are usually going to show up correctly.

The range is the window what you would like to see.

NOTE: FOR GRAPHING EQUATIONS, YOU CAN NOT WRITE 2X. YOU MUST TYPE IT AS 2*X. ALSO TRY TO NOT USE QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS. THESE WILL NOT SHOW UP CORRECTLY
